### Honesty: Created World | v1.2

_Minecraft 1.20.1_ | _Forge 47.3.0_ 


### Changes/Improvements ‚≠ê

- **Main Menu:** Remixed the Legacy RST Create menu for the Honesty series. Volume is controlled by the Jukebox/Noteblock audio options.
- **Better Combat:** We are giving the Better Combat system a shot. It has compatibility with Alexs Caves.
- **Removed Bloat:** Removed some redundant mods to improve load times and reduce the number of items.
- **Shader Optimizations:** Several updates to shaders and their integration with Create to enhance performance. (There are issues with Complementary)
- **Resource Packs:** Added/removed textures and animations to achieve a dark mode + Create themes.
- **Quests:** Added several new quests as well as a money themed quest meant for mid to late or even post game content. (WIP)
- **Server Config Tweaks:** Some things have been tweaked server-side that can't be reflected on SSP.
- **Dynmap:** Will be up and ready to go sometime this patch.


### Bug Fixes üêõ

- **Sheet Recipes:** There were conflicts in how sheets were handled in recipes. I applied a script to fix this by allowing any plate of the correct material for recipes.
- **Super Heated Blaze Burners:** Previously, giving the burners a Blaze Cake only heated them. Now, they should superheat as intended, and you should see them turn blue.
- **AE2 Polymorph:** It was impossible to polymorph craft items that had the same recipe as others in AE2 interfaces. There is now a Polymorph button within ME Terminals.
- **Unique Item Stacks:** It was possible to offhand a Create item, and its NBT data would become corrupted, causing it not to stack with other identical items.
- **Invisible Enemies:** It was possible to encounter a fully invisible monster in the world. This should be fixed now.
    - If they ever appear invisible to you, ensure that both `Block Face Culling` and `Max Block Entity` are disabled in Video options.
- **Item Tags:** Using some scripts, I made some item tags to make searching easier:
    - Searching `$agriculture`, `$decor_stations`, or `$doughs` in JEI will narrow down to a group of `@mod` or `@item` tags I felt would fit in this category.
    - If you can think of more useful tags, let me know!
- **Food Plates:** There were compatibility issues with crafting food display plates. You should be able to craft them now, and their recipes should show in JEI.
- **Chisel/Chipped Compatibility:** There should be more cross-compatibility between Chisel and Chipped in general.
- **Wood Support:** I can't fix them all, but more of the custom woods should at least be usable to make chests now.
- **Quest Book:** Ensured you receive a quest book on first login now.
- **Removed Craft:** Made Suspicious Sand and Suspicious Gravel uncraftable.
- **AE2 Cables:** You can now 2x2 craft the normal cables to get their dense version.
    - Again, let me know of other recipes like this we could add or change!
- **Trackwork:** Wheels and components would show as invisible. This should be corrected now.
    - If they ever appear invisible to you, ensure that both `Block Face Culling` and `Max Block Entity` are disabled in Video options.
- **Broken Quests:** Removed broken quests or fixed existing ones.


### Known Issues ‚òπÔ∏è

- **Complementary Shaders + Essential:** There is an issue with the Essential suite and Complementary Shaders specifically that causes enchanted glint items to appear as solid black in inventory screens randomly.
    - You can work around this by removing Essential, which is a cosmetic MTX add-on.
    - Alternatively, you can use a different shader, such as the included MakeUp - Ultra Fast, or any other shader you prefer.
    - Lastly, you can just deal with it I guess!
- **Complementary Shaders:** There is an issue when toggling Complementary Shaders off and back on; the game will crash. The game runs fine with the shaders, but switching back and forth is not possible.
    - You can toggle shaders back on without crashing by switching to MakeUp - Ultra Fast, enabling shaders, and then switching back to Complementary Shaders.
